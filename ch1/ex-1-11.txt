the kind of inputs with wich i would test the word counting program:

and nothing should give me zero word, a count of zero and zero new line.

an input with a space like "programming language", "should give me two word, a count of 3 and zero new line"

an input with a new line like "programming\nlanguage", "should give me two word, a count of 3 and one new line"

an input with a tab like "programming\tlanguage", "should give me two word, a count of 3 and zero new line"
